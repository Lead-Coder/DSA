Given an array of strings nums containing n unique binary strings each of length n, return a binary string of length n that does not appear in nums. 
If there are multiple answers, you may return any of them.

Example 1:
Input: nums = ["01","10"]
Output: "11"
Explanation: "11" does not appear in nums. "00" would also be correct.

Example 2:
Input: nums = ["00","01"]
Output: "11"
Explanation: "11" does not appear in nums. "10" would also be correct.


class Solution {
public:
    string findDifferentBinaryString(vector<string>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        string res = "";
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            if(nums[i][i] == '0') {
                res += '1';
            }else {
                res += '0';
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
};
